# Project Timeline

### Phase 1 (Months 1–3, $25,000)
Analyzes client-provided GPS data (DBSCAN clustering for Markov transitions), LiDAR, weather, and turbine data; designs ABM with Markov/Bayesian components. 
Deliverable: Processed datasets, ABM design document, prototype graph (Gephi). Use: Client confirms data suitability and model approach.

### Phase 2 (Months 4–6, $25,000) 
Implements ABM (mesa) with GPS-derived Markov transitions and Bayesian updating (Beta distribution). Simulates 100 years (1,000 harriers, 60 turbines). 
Deliverable: ABM script, initial results, curtailment schedule. Use: Client tests outputs for mitigation planning.

### Phase 3 (Months 7–9, $25,000) 
Calibrates model with Eastern Cape WEF data (e.g., 5 fatalities/4 years), optimizes transitions/priors, develops QGIS risk maps and Gephi visualizations. 
Deliverable: Refined ABM, visualizations, mitigation report. Use: Client assesses high-risk zones and mitigation strategies.

### Phase 4 (Months 10–12, $25,000) 
Validates model with client-provided field data, conducts virtual stakeholder workshop, finalizes documentation. 
Deliverable: Validated results, final curtailment schedule, report, presentation. Use: Client implements or proceeds to validation.

### Optional Validation (Months 13–15, $13,440, grant-funded) 
Analyzes client-provided field data (e.g., carcass surveys), updates model, prepares publication draft. 
Deliverable: Validated model, updated outputs, publication draft. Use: Client deploys or expands to other WEFs.
